	// TO DO:
	//=======
	
	// Each <h2> element names a martial art. Use a selector to pick up all three descriptive paragraphs that 
	// follow <h2>s. Ensure that all three paragraphs are initially hidden when the user sees the page.
	

		$(".planDesc").hide();
		
	// TO DO:
	//=======
	
	// Use a click-event handler to ensure that whenever an <h2> element is clicked,
	// we display the following paragraph if it was already hidden. If the paragraph 
	// was already visible, then hide it when the mouse is clicked on the <h2>. In other 
	// words, we alternate between hide and revealing the paragraph.
	
	// Specify a one-second duration (or longer) so that the element doesn't just appear or 
	// disappear suddenly.
